A Volunteer Coordinator’s job is difficult enough. What if we could condense several of the most crucial aspects of the position into one simple, lightweight app? We’ve done it! With Conveyance, you manage your volunteer network in the palm of your hand. View who is currently active in your network and send out blast campaigns via SMS to keep your volunteers informed.
